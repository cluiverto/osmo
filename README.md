# OSMO

OSMO is a framework in the field of olfactory intelligence, built upon the latest scientific research and literature focused on digital representation and analysis of scents. The project leverages advances in artificial olfaction to enable computers to "understand" and classify odors based on molecular structure.

The OSMO framework is designed for seamless integration with DeepChem  [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem )- a machine learning toolkit for molecular chemistry and biology - as well as PyRfume [pyrfume](https://pyrfume.org/), an open-source platform for olfactory data analysis and exploration. This combination allows advanced modeling, analysis, and visualization of odors, supporting both scientific research and practical applications in perfumery, healthcare, and safety.

### Key features of OSMO:

Based on foundational research and literature in olfactory intelligence and digital odor mapping.

Integration with DeepChem for machine learning models in molecular chemistry.

Integration with PyRfume for access to olfactory data tools and databases.

Extensible architecture to incorporate custom models, data sources, and analyses.

OSMO represents a new generation of tools enabling computers to recognize, map, and synthesize odors, opening new possibilities in science, medicine, and the fragrance industry.
